# PROJECTNAME

## Objective

The primary objective of creating a home lab environment focusing on Active Directory with PowerShell automation is help develop a deep understanding of managing and securing Windows networks.  This project aims to simulate real-world corporate IT infrastructure scenarios, allowing for hands-on experience in configuring, automating, and securing directory services. By incorporating PowerShell scripting for automation and administrative tasks, the lab will serve as a platform to further my learning in cybersecurity.

### Key Goals

<strong>Active Directory Configuration and Management:</strong>
<br>-To establish a fully functional Active Directory environment that simulates enterprise setups, enabling the practice of user and group management, policy implementation, and access controls.
<br><strong>PowerShell Automation Mastery:</strong>
<br>-To achieve proficiency in PowerShell scripting tailored to automate repetitive Active Directory management tasks
<br><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong>
<br>-To implement and experiment with advanced AD security measures, including Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for endpoint security and to understand the role of AD in organizational cybersecurity frameworks.
<br><strong>Network Services Integration:</strong>
<br>-To integrate essential network services such as DNS and DHCP within the Active Directory lab environment.
<br><strong>Remote Access and File Services Configuration:</strong>
<br>-To integrate essential network services such as DNS and DHCP within the Active Directory lab environment, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of how AD interacts with other core network services and protocols.
<br><strong>Remote Access and File Services Configuration:</strong>
<br>-To set up and manage Remote Access Services and configure Windows File Servers to simulate remote working scenarios and data storage management

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
