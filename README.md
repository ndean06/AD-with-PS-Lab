# PROJECTNAME

## Objective

The primary objective of creating a home lab environment focusing on Active Directory with PowerShell automation is help develop a deep understanding of managing and securing Windows networks.  This project aims to simulate real-world corporate IT infrastructure scenarios, allowing for hands-on experience in configuring, automating, and securing directory services. By incorporating PowerShell scripting for automation and administrative tasks, the lab will serve as a platform to further my learning in cybersecurity.
